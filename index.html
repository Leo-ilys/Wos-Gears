      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Leo, a solo developer. Welcome to my personal project: Chief Gear Simulator.

This simulator allows you to estimate the materials required to upgrade gears all the way to max level. It also features a Total Material Used summary that automatically tracks all materials consumed.

To help you better match your game account, I've added features like Set Level, Reset Level, and Input Materials â€” giving you full flexibility. There's also a Reset Materials button if you want to start fresh.

Please note: this tool is strictly for simulation and personal calculation purposes only. It is not intended for any illegal activity whatsoever.

If you find this project helpful and would like to support my work, you can make a contact through this link:
